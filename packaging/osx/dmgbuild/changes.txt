This is from the dmgbuild project: http://alastairs-place.net/projects/dmgbuild

This is version 1.0 and modified in the following ways:
- removed the need for the `six` module, while keeping (the partial) Python3 compatibility
- individual items copied into the dmg now keep their permission (e.g.: executables)
- the ‘defines’ now override settings (as stated)
